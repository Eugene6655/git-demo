ulala in LA
ulala in the USA
Ooh la la in L.A., Ooh la la in the U.S.A.
Making out every turned on a hit and miss.
You see the food and you feel the force,
B.L.T. and there ain't no sauce,
You get enough to feed a horse
that's true.

Just look in my eyes and you'll see russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you'll see russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you'll see russian paradise
Just look in my eyes and you'll see russian paradise


My Escalade is like Boing 747
I start in this round at eleven
The time is 11:45
This is my life, my mind and my fly
